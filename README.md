# PPVM

(Python?) compiler I'm writing as part of learning Rust and compilers
This will start with a subset of whatever PL I choose

## Roadmap
- Define an AST structure that the compiler will work with  
- Generate the rules that the AST will be evaluated by  
- Create a parser to read ??? and generate the AST  
- Create a static typechecker that can be run against python code
- Idk just do whatever seems to be missing from the framework
